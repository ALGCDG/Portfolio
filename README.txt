This folder contains a small sample of some programs I have written recently.
The folder should contain 3 files,

1) Perlin.cs: An implementation of 2D Perlin noise for the Unity game engine, and part of my Undergraduate Research work at Imperial.

2) QuickHull.py: A small piece of python code I wrote for the purposes of illustarting how the convex hull algorithm QuickHull works in 2D.

3) QuickHull3D.cs: A first working draft of the convex hull algorithm QuickHull for 3D, to be used in the Unity game engine to produce valid triangle arrays for a mesh. This I recently wrote as part of my continued work with researchers at Imperial. 

Thank you very much,
Archibald Crichton
